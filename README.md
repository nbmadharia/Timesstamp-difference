# Timesstamp-difference

Write a function in python that inputs a dataframe and identify which columns have date in them. Using these date columns make new columns which are difference between these columns taking 2 at a time. (for instance if there is date1, date2, date3 columns, output should be like date1-date2, date2-date3, date1-date3 )

Thing to consider

· Date column might have some invalid entries in them

· Date can be of different format throughout the column

· Code should be efficient and fast

· Code should be well commented and easy to interpret

· Use google Colab

· Code should be robust enough to run on any dataset

· Make a dummy dataset by yourself or pass any publicly available dataset to test out your logic
